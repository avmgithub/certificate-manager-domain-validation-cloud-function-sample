# Certificate Order - DNS Domain Validation sample
## General
IBM Cloud Certificate Manager lets you order TLS certificates signed by Letâ€™s Encrypt.

When you order a certificate, you have to prove that you own the domains for which you are requesting the certificate for. This repository contains sample code to show you how to prove you own these domains.

The sample demonstrates how to implement an IBM Cloud Function action that receives a domain validation challenge from Certificate Manager, and answers it.

The Cloud Function action receives a notification from Certificate Manager containing a DNS TXT record challenge, and then adds this to the DNS provider where the requested domain is registered. Once the domain validation challenge is answered, the Cloud Function also clears this TXT record from the DNS service.

In this sample we used IBM Cloud Internet Services as our DNS provider, where we registered our domains, but you can use this sample with any other DNS provider that offers an API for updating TXT records.

## Prerequisites
 
1. An instance of [IBM Cloud Certificate Manager.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/certificate-manager)
2. Account in SoftLayer

## Configuration
### IBM Cloud Function action
1. Create a new [IBM Cloud Function action](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk/index.html#openwhisk_start_hello_world)
   
   * In IBM Cloud Functions, select **Actions** from the sidebar
   * Click on **Create**
   * Follow the on-screen instructions
   
2. Deploy the sample
   
   Select **Code** from the sidebar, and paste the contents of the **main.js** file of the sample
 
3. [Bind parameters to the action](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk/parameters.html#default-params-action) 

   Select **Parameters** from the sidebar, and add the following:
   
    1. `allowedCertificateManagerCRNs` - a JSON Object containing a list of Certificate Manager instances that are allowed to invoke this function.
        Apply it in order to protect your cloud function from being invoked by unauthorized clients.  
        E.g. `{"crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloudcerts:us-south:a....":true,"crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloudcerts:eu-de:a...":true}` 
        
        * Find your Certificate Manager instance CRN from the Settings sidebar item
        * Or from CLI: `ibmcloud resource service-instance [INSTANCE NAME]`, grab the `ID` value
       
    2. `cmRegion` - your Certificate Manager service instance region value. Can be one of: `us-south`, `eu-gb`, `eu-de`, `jp-tok`  
        E.g. `"us-south"`
 
    3. `softLayerUser` - IBM id of an owner of SoftLayer account (it looks like `IBM1234567`)
    
    4. `softLayerApiKey` - apikey of an owner of SoftLayer account
 
         * Create an API key in **SoftLayer -> Account -> Users**, select user, click on **Generate** .
         
  4. In the **Endpoints** sidebar, tick the **Enable as Web Action** checkbox
